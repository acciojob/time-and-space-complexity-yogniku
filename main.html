	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a programming term that quantifies the amount of time it takes a sequence of code or an algorithm to process or execute in proportion to the size and cost of input. It will not look at an algorithm's overall execution time.it states how code is efficient.</p>
	 <p><b>Space complexity</b> refers to the total amount of memory space used by an algorithm/program, including the space of input values for execution. Calculate the space occupied by variables in an algorithm/program to determine space complexity. However, people frequently confuse Space-complexity with auxiliary space. It is denoted by 0(n).</p>
