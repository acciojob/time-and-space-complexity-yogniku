    <h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size. In other words, it quantifies the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the time it takes to execute. An algorithm with efficient time complexity is desirable as it ensures faster execution, especially when dealing with large datasets.

    <p>
        Space Complexity, on the other hand, refers to the amount of memory space an algorithm requires as a function of the input size. It is essential to consider space complexity to optimize memory usage and avoid excessive consumption. In algorithm analysis, we often use Big O notation, such as O(n), to express the upper bound of the space complexity. <b>Space Complexity</b> is a critical aspect of designing algorithms, ensuring they use memory efficiently.
